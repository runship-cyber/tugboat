      # configure this action. If you'd like Tugboat to create the Markdown file
      # and pull request in another repository, you'll need to create a personal
      # access token with repo scope and store it as an encrypted secret for the
      # repository where you configure this action. Consider using a personal
      # access token for a machine user account on GitHub.
